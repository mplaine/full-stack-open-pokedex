# Exercise 11.1

Continuous Integration (CI) is a widely adopted practice in software engineering where developers merge their code changes to the main branch as often as possible. Each merge (and commit in general) then triggers a pipeline where the code is automatically linted, built, and tested to accelerate software development and ensure everything works as expected. Popular code repositories and cloud providers all come with built-in support for CI to automate different phases of the software release process. For example, GitHub has GitHub Actions, GitLab offers GitLab CI/CD, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) service portfolio includes AWS CodePipeline. Alternatively, a self-hosted CI system like Jenkins can be set up to run in almost any environment.

In a Python project, a CI pipeline is typically configured to automate two steps: (i) code linting and formatting and (ii) running tests. As Python is an interpreted programming language, there is no need for an additional step to build the code. Some of the most popular tools for improving Python code quality include mypy (linter), Flake8 (linter), isort (formatter), and Black (formatter).

For a small open-source project with only six developers, it makes sense to start with a cloud-based solution, such as GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a hassle free and adequent option that offers free usage in public and private (with limitations) repositories.
